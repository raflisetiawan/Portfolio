      I started learning about web-development in my early high-school, where I
      was introduced to HTML and CSS. I quickly started writing small webpages
      with simple HTML and little of CSS. After my high-school, I took some time
      to myself and explored the web development world more and found many
      frameworks. Out of all, I found my love for Vue.js. Since then, I've been
      mastering it, and with every new project I added a new tool, like
      Bootstrap, Express and more.

      Outside of my worklife, I love to play Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel and Dota2, listening to
      Em. on Spotify, or just hanging out on Discord with my friends. You can
